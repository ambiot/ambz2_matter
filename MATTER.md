# Matter (previously CHIP) on AmebaZ2

## Reminder

### For v1.3.0.0 onwards, all-clusters-app.zap location change

If you need to change all-clusters-app.zap, please change it in the following directory:

	component/common/application/matter/example/chiptest/all-clusters-app.zap

This is because we have added all files required for all supported clusters in project/realtek_amebaz2_v0_example/GCC-RELEASE/lib_chip_main.mk, while the default all-clusters-app.zap in connectedhomeip does not include some clusters supported by Ameba. Therefore, build errors occur.

The only solution is to add Ameba's all-clusters-app.zap. 

In project/realtek_amebaz2_v0_example/GCC-RELEASE/Makefile, the default all-clusters-app.zap in connectedhomeip will be replaced by Ameba's all-clusters-app.zap

	@cp $(MATTER_DIR)/example/chiptest/all-clusters-app.zap $(ALL_CLUSTERS_ZAP)

## Run CHIP task on AmebaZ2 (all-cluster-app/lighting-app/ota-requestor-app example)

	Matter task will auto start after reset the device.

## Test with [chip-tool](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/examples/chip-tool)
Use standalone chip-tool app(linux) to communicate with the device. The Chip-tool is a software utility designed to assist developers and manufacturers working on Matter-compatible devices.
It provides various functionalities to interact with Matter-enabled devices, such as commissioning, controlling, and monitoring their operations. 
The Chip-tool is an essential component for developers working on Matter devices as it allows them to validate their implementations, debug issues, and ensure interoperability with other Matter devices. 
Additionally, it assists in configuring and managing Matter networks, making it easier for developers to create robust and reliable smart home and IoT solutions.

As a commissioner, the Chip-tool facilitates the provisioning and configuration of Matter devices within a network. It assigns necessary network addresses, security keys, and other parameters to newly added devices, ensuring their seamless integration into the Matter network.

In order to send commands to a device, the device must be commissioned into the Matter network. The configuration state for chip-tool is stored in `/tmp/chip_tool_config.ini`; deleting this and other `.ini` files in `/tmp` can sometimes resolve issues due to stale configuration.

### Commission a device over BLE-WiFi

* Run CHIP-TOOL ble-wifi commissioning command `./chip-tool pairing ble-wifi <NODE_ID> <SSID> <PASSWORD> 20202021 3840`
* For example: `./chip-tool pairing ble-wifi 12344321 testssid password 20202021 3840`

### Commission a device over IP (For devices already on the WiFi network)

* Connect Ameba to AP using `ATW0, ATW1, ATWC` commands
* Run CHIP-TOOL onnetwork commissioning command `./chip-tool pairing onnetwork <NODE_ID> 20202021`
* For example: `./chip-tool pairing onnetwork 12344321 20202021`

### Command for onoff cluster

Use PA_20 as output, connect a LED to this pin and GND.

* Run CHIP-TOOL on-off cluster command `./chip-tool onoff on 12344321 1`

* Run CHIP-TOOL on-off cluster command `./chip-tool onoff off 12344321 1`


Find more detail in [chip-tool](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/examples/chip-tool)

## Test with [Android Chip-Tool](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/examples/android/CHIPTool)

### Install Android Studio
* Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=Cj0KCQjwkIGKBhCxARIsAINMioLrotRhWXySwLrveax_JTX-qt1H-zjyGBEZk2FtseA-SYmQYmpq9M4aApGsEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds#downloads) and [Android-NDK-r21e](https://github.com/android/ndk/wiki/Unsupported-Downloads) and extract the files.
* Launch Android Studio: `cd android-studio/bin` and run `./studio.sh`
* Go to **Customize** and **All settings**. Under **Appearance & Behaviour** >> **System Settings** >> **Android SDK**, Check **Android 5.0 (Lollipop)** and uncheck the rest. Default Android SDK location is at `~/Android/Sdk`.

### Preparing for build

Run the following commands

	cd connectedhomeip/
	source script/bootstrap.sh
	export ANDROID_HOME=~/Android/Sdk
	export ANDROID_NDK_HOME={path to android-ndk-r21e}
	
Target CPU
`TARGET_CPU` can have the following values, depending on your smartphone CPU
architecture:

| ABI         | TARGET_CPU |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| armeabi-v7a | arm        |
| arm64-v8a   | arm64      |
| x86         | x86        |
| x86_64      | x64        |

Complete the following steps to prepare the Matter build:

1. Check out the Matter repository.

2. Run bootstrap (**only required first time**)

    ```shell
    source scripts/bootstrap.sh
    ```

3. Choose how you want to build the Android CHIPTool. There are **two** ways:
   from script, or from source within Android Studio.

<a name="building-scripts"></a>

### Building Android CHIPTool from scripts

This is the simplest option. In the command line, run the following command from
the top CHIP directory:

```shell
./scripts/build/build_examples.py --target android-arm64-chip-tool build
```
Note: It has been noticed that this step may fail on the first try, but running the second time will successfully build the apk.

See the table above for other values of `TARGET_CPU`.

The debug Android package `app-debug.apk` will be generated at
`out/android-$TARGET_CPU-chip-tool/outputs/apk/debug/`, and can be installed
with

```shell
adb install out/android-$TARGET_CPU-chip-tool/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

You can use Android Studio to edit the Android CHIPTool app itself and run it
after build_examples.py, but you will not be able to edit Matter Android code
from `src/controller/java`, or other Matter C++ code within Android Studio.

<a name="building-studio"></a>

### Building Android CHIPTool from Android Studio

This option allows Android Studio to build the core Matter code from source,
which allows us to directly edit core Matter code in-IDE.

1. In the command line, run the following command from the top Matter directory:

    ```shell
    TARGET_CPU=arm64 ./scripts/examples/android_app_ide.sh
    ```

    See the table above for other values of `TARGET_CPU`.

2. Modify the `matterSdkSourceBuild` variable to true, `matterBuildSrcDir` point
   to the appropriate output directory (e.g. `../../../../out/android_arm64`),
   and `matterSourceBuildAbiFilters` to the desired ABIs in
   [src/android/CHIPTool/gradle.properties](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/src/android/CHIPTool/gradle.properties)

3) Open the project in Android Studio and run **Sync Project with Gradle
   Files**.

4) Use one of the following options to build an Android package:

    - Click **Make Project** in Android Studio.
    - Run the following command in the command line:

        ```shell
        cd src/android/CHIPTool
        ./gradlew build
        ```

The debug Android package `app-debug.apk` will be generated at
`src/android/CHIPTool/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`, and can be installed with

```shell
adb install src/android/CHIPTool/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

or

```shell
(cd src/android/CHIPTool && ./gradlew installDebug)
```

### BLE Commissioning
* Power on device and wait matter task run
* Launch Android Chip-Tool app and press **Provision CHIP Device With Wi-Fi**
* Scan the QR Code and enter the network credentials of the AP

Note: The QR code will be provided when booting, for example:
```shell
chip[SVR] SetupQRCode: [MT:-24J042C00KA0648G00]
chip[SVR] Copy/paste the below URL in a browser to see the QR Code:
chip[SVR] https://dhrishi.github.io/connectedhomeip/qrcode.html?data=MT%3A-24J042C00KA0648G00
```
Copy/paste the URL in a browser and a scannable QR code will be displayed.
